## [Yelp JSON Helper visualization summary](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/silvio.sopic/viz/Yelpfusioncategoryhelper/Dashboard1)
Yelp Fusion API retrieves location and tags of various objects around a given latitude and longitude. The visualization represents tag structures. For instance, a restaurant can be labeled as a Mexican or Croatian restaurant, or both (fusion tag). The length of the bar chart indicates the tag count. Tags are crucial for comprehending specific object types during subsequent analysis.

### Summary:
- **Yelp Fusion API:** Utilized for obtaining location and tags of objects near specified coordinates.
- **Visualization Focus:** Highlights tag structures rather than specific locations.
- **Tag Structure Example:** Restaurants might have multiple tags like "Mexican," "Croatian," or a fusion of both tags.
- **Bar Chart Length:** Represents the tag count, providing insights into tag prevalence.
- **Significance of Tags:** Crucial for understanding object details in later analysis stages.

## [Points of interest and their ranking](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/silvio.sopic/viz/YelpingaroundKingsCountydoubleselector/Dashboard1)
Utilizing the Yelp Fusion application with latitude and longitude variables from the "convenience visualization" (but any mesh can be used) enables the understanding of specific elements' locations within a city. This information is crucial for interpreting geographical data, providing insights not only about the presence of locations like parks but also detailing their quality. For instance, distinguishing between a clean park and a dirty one impacts their respective surroundings differently. The visualization allows exploration of the surroundings of a selected location on a map. Filters on the left facilitate drill-down based on main tags from Yelp Fusion JSON. Certain brands may have multiple stores and their numbers and ratings are depicted on the treemap to the right. Further drill-down options are available in the filters below.

### Summary
- Yelp Fusion Application: Utilized with latitude and longitude variables for understanding city elements' whereabouts.
- Significance of Geographical Data: Provides insights into the quality of locations, not just their presence.
- Visualization Functionality: Explores surroundings based on a selected map location.
- Left Filters: Facilitate drill-down based on primary tags from Yelp Fusion JSON data.
- Prevalence of Specific Stores: Notable stores like convenience stores are more visible; their numbers and ratings are displayed on the treemap.
- Further Drill-Down: Available through filters below, allowing for deeper exploration and analysis.

The chart serves as a comprehensive tool for analyzing main variables in real estate data. Users can select X and Y variables, which can be nominal or continuous, and can also be left blank as needed. The X variable determines the bubble sizes in the map chart, while the Y variable defines the color intensity. The scatterplot to the right visualizes the relationship between the selected X and Y variables. The histogram is used to observe variable distribution, with the Y variable used for selection. Additionally, a boxplot is available at the bottom left, allowing the display of a single variable or combining a continuous variable with a nominal one to analyze the distribution based on the nominal variable.

### Summary
- Purpose of the Chart: Offers an all-in-one view of key variables used in real estate data analysis.
- Variable Selection: X and Y variables can be chosen and can be nominal, continuous, or left blank.
- Bubble Chart: Utilizes X variable for bubble sizes and Y for color intensity on the map chart.
- Scatterplot Explanation: Demonstrates the relationship between selected X and Y variables.
- Histogram Usage: Visualizes variable distribution, with Y variable serving for selection.
- Boxplot Functionality: Available at the bottom left, displays a single variable or combines continuous with nominal variables for distribution analysis.
