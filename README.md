## [Yelp JSON Helper visualization summary](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/silvio.sopic/viz/Yelpfusioncategoryhelper/Dashboard1)
Summary:
Yelp Fusion API retrieves location and tags of various objects around a given latitude and longitude. The visualization represents tag structures. For instance, a restaurant can be labeled as a Mexican or Croatian restaurant, or both (fusion tag). The length of the bar chart indicates the tag count. Tags are crucial for comprehending specific object types during subsequent analysis.

Summary:
Utilizing the Yelp Fusion application with latitude and longitude variables or a pre-created mesh enables the understanding of specific elements' locations within a city. This information is crucial for interpreting geographical data, providing insights not only about the presence of locations like parks but also detailing their quality. For instance, distinguishing between a clean park and a dirty one impacts their respective surroundings differently. The visualization allows exploration of the surroundings of a selected location on a map. Filters on the left facilitate drill-down based on main tags from Yelp Fusion JSON. Certain stores, like convenience stores, may be more prevalent, and their numbers and ratings are depicted on the treemap to the right. Further drill-down options are available in the filters below.
